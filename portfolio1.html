        <h3>Bluetooth Controlled Electronic Home Appliances Circuit Principle</h3>
        <p>
In this project, a Bluetooth module is interfaced to 8051 Microcontroller. This Bluetooth Module receives the commands from the Android application that is installed on the Android device, using wireless communication (Bluetooth Technology). The program which is written to the 8051 microcontroller communicates with Bluetooth module serially to receive the commands. Microcontroller switches the electrical loads automatically based on the commands received from the Bluetooth..</p>

        <h3>Password Based Circuit Breaker</h3>
        <p> Password Based Circuit Breaker is a simple project that helps in controlling the electrical lines with the help of a password.

Nowadays, electrical accidents to the line man are increasing, while repairing the electrical lines due to the lack of communication between the electrical substation and maintenance staff. This project gives a solution to this problem to ensure line man safety. In this proposed system, the control (ON/OFF) of the electrical lines lies with line man. This project is arranged in such a way that maintenance staff or line man has to enter the password to ON/OFF the electrical line.

Now, if there is any fault in electrical line, then the line man will switch off the power supply to the line by entering password and comfortably repair the electrical line, and after coming to the substation line man switch on the supply to the particular line by entering the password. Separate passwords are assigned for each electrical lines.
